          <h2>Correlations Discovered Between several factors from the US Census Bureau, 2014 ACS 1-year estimates </h2>
          <p>The default graph displays the correlation between the mean of income and  mean of healthcare between states.
            I initially hypothesized that these factors would be positively correlated. However after constructing 
            the graph for it, it almost looks as if there's a negative correlation, albeit a small one. 
            This may be the case because people with higher incomes can afford a more healthy lifestyle.
            In addition they may also be more prepared for health related issues because of their large income.</p>

          <p>Another correlation worth noting would be between smoking and obesity. From a visual standpoint it seems that 
            there's a positive correlation between the two. This may be because obese individuals may have low self-control 
            and it turn are more likely to turn to unhealthy habits.
          </p>

          <p>But, enough from me! Give my interactive project a try and see what correlations lie within this 3x3 factor 
            graph.</p>
