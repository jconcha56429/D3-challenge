# US_2014_Census_Bureau_Data_Visualization
Hello there! This project is set to analyze the correlation between several factors from the US census Bureau's 
2014 ACS 1-year estimates. Inside there are some basic d3 graph, axis, and scale transitions which I accomplished with javascript and html. In addition I utilized d3's tool tip to show where the data actually resides. I had to give this project a lot of thought before diving into this challenge. I also ran into many issues when it came to scaling and getting the graph to transition smoothly. However as always with coding, doing something new taught me so much about making graphs more aesthetically pleasing with d3!
